Assumptions made:

1) The number plates always follow the same format of memory tag (2 letter), Age identifier (2 numbers), then 3 random letters at the end
ie this excludes private plates that could have just 3 or 4 digits on the number plate

2) The date of the plate must be after March 1st 2001
ie the way the age identifier was calculated changed after March 1st 2001, as before then it was just 1 letter identifying the year

3) Assume the memory tag and random letters do not include 'I' and/or 'Q'

4) Assume that hardcoded values are valid
ie there is no validation confirming this like there is for custom values

5) Assume the user provides valid input when on the menu option
ie there is no handling for invalid inputs

6) Assume user has the authority to view all previously generated plates
